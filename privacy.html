        disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
      <p>Where possible, We apply shorter retention periods and/or reduce identifiability by deleting, aggregating, or
        anonymizing data. Unless otherwise stated, the retention periods below are maximum periods ("up to") and We may
        delete or anonymize data sooner when it is no longer needed for the relevant purpose. We apply different
        retention periods to different categories of Personal Data based on the purpose of processing and legal
        obligations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> retained for the duration of your account relationship plus up to 24

              history, amounts) for up to 10 years from the date of transaction to comply with tax laws and financial
              regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing and invoice records:</strong> up to 10 years to meet accounting and tax compliance
              requirements.</li>

          for tax authorities).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal claims:</strong> Data is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Your explicit request:</strong> You ask Us to retain specific information.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical limitations:</strong> Data exists in backup systems that are scheduled for routine
          deletion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may request information about how long We will retain Your Personal Data by contacting Us.</p>
      <p>When retention periods expire, We securely delete or anonymize Personal Data according to the following
        procedures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Personal Data is removed from Our systems and no longer actively processed.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup retention:</strong> Residual copies may remain in encrypted backups for a limited period
          consistent with our backup retention schedule and are not restored except where necessary for security,
          disaster recovery, or legal compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymization:</strong> In some cases, We convert Personal Data into anonymous statistical data that
          cannot be linked back to You. This anonymized data may be retained indefinitely for research and
          analytics.</li>
      </ul>

        to appropriate safeguards and supplementary measures where appropriate. The Company will take all steps

      <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>We may use or disclose and may have used or disclosed in the last twelve (12) months the following categories
        of
        personal information for business or commercial purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Category A: Identifiers</li>
        <li>Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ.
          Code

        <li>Category D: Commercial information</li>
        <li>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When We disclose Personal Information for a business purpose or a commercial purpose, We enter a contract that
        describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use
        it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>

      <h3>Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>We may share, and have shared in the last twelve (12) months, Your personal information identified in the above
        categories with the following categories of third parties:</p>
      <ul>

          connection with products or services We provide to You</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sale of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>As defined in the CCPA/CPRA, "sell" and "sale" mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating,
        making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means,
        a
        Consumer's personal information by the Business to a third party for valuable consideration.</p>
      <p>We do not "sell" or "share" information as most people would commonly understand these terms – meaning We do
        not, and will not, disclose Your Personal Information in direct exchange for money or some other form of
        payment.</p>

      <h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>We retain California residents' Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to achieve the
        purposes
        described in this Privacy Policy, taking into account: (i) how long we need the information to provide and
        maintain the Service and Your Account; (ii) whether You have requested deletion (subject to applicable
        exceptions); (iii) Our legal, tax, accounting, and regulatory obligations; (iv) security, fraud prevention, and
        abuse monitoring needs; and (v) the time periods needed to resolve disputes and enforce Our agreements.</p>
      <p>Specific retention periods for major data categories are described in the "Retention of Your Personal Data"
        section of Our Privacy Policy, and We may retain certain information longer where required or permitted by
        law.</p>

      <h3>Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age</h3>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our Service, although
        certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use
        and privacy policies and We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and
        instruct their children to never provide information on other websites without their permission.</p>
      <p>We do not sell the Personal Information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless We
        receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 16
        years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of future sales at any time.
        To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by
        contacting Us.</p>
      <p>If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided Us with personal information,
        please contact Us with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that information.</p>
