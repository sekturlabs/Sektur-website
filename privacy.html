    statistical data that cannot be linked back to You. This anonymized data

Disclosure of Personal Information  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may use or disclose and may have used or disclosed in the last twelve (12)
months the following categories of personal information for business or
commercial purposes:

  * Category A: Identifiers
  * Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California
    Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))
  * Category D: Commercial information
  * Category F: Internet or other similar network activity

Please note that the categories listed above are those defined in the
CCPA/CPRA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of personal
information were in fact disclosed, but reflects our good faith belief to the
best of our knowledge that some of that information from the applicable
category may be and may have been disclosed.

When We disclose Personal Information for a business purpose or a commercial
purpose, We enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the
recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it
for any purpose except performing the contract.

Sharing of Personal Information  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may share, and have shared in the last twelve (12) months, Your personal
information identified in the above categories with the following categories
of third parties:

  * Our business partners
  * Third-party vendors to whom You or Your agents authorize Us to disclose
    Your personal information in connection with products or services We
    provide to You

Sale of Personal Information  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As defined in the CCPA/CPRA, "sell" and "sale" mean selling, renting,
releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or
otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a
Consumer's personal information by the Business to a third party for valuable
consideration. This means that We may have received some kind of benefit in
return for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary
benefit.

We do not "sell" or "share" information as most people would commonly
understand these terms – meaning We do not, and will not, disclose Your
Personal Information in direct exchange for money or some other form of
payment.

We may disclose or may have disclosed in the last twelve (12) months the
following categories in a manner that may be considered a "sale" or "sharing"
as defined in CCPA/CPRA:

  * Category A: Identifiers
  * Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California
    Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))
  * Category D: Commercial information
  * Category F: Internet or other similar network activity

Please note that the categories listed above are those defined in the
CCPA/CPRA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of personal
information were in fact sold, but reflects our good faith belief to the best
of Our knowledge that some of that information from the applicable category
may be and may have been shared for value in return.

Retention of Personal Information  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We retain California residents' Personal Information for as long as reasonably
necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (including
the purposes disclosed in this CCPA/CPRA notice), taking into account: (i) how
long we need the information to provide and maintain the Service and Your
Account; (ii) whether You have requested deletion (subject to applicable
exceptions); (iii) Our legal, tax, accounting, and regulatory obligations;
(iv) security, fraud prevention, and abuse monitoring needs; and (v) the time
periods needed to resolve disputes and enforce Our agreements.

Specific retention periods for major data categories are described in the
"Retention of Your Personal Information" section of Our Privacy Policy, and We
may retain certain information longer where required or permitted by law (for
example, to comply with recordkeeping obligations or to establish, exercise,
or defend legal claims).

Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of
16 through our Service, although certain third party websites that we link to
may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use and privacy
policies and We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never provide
information on other websites without their permission.

We do not sell the Personal Information of Consumers We actually know are less
than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the "right
to opt-in") from the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 16 years of
age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of
future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your
authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.

If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided Us
