                <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                <p>By downloading, installing, or using any SEKTUR application, or by accessing the SEKTUR website
                    (sektur.com), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not
                    use any SEKTUR app or website.</p>
                <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and SEKTUR, based in California,
                    United States. Individual SEKTUR apps may supplement these Terms with app-specific terms where
                    needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use any SEKTUR app or the SEKTUR website. By using our
                    products, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. If you are between 13 and 18
                    years old, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms
                    on your behalf.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>3. License to Use</h2>
                <p>Subject to these Terms, SEKTUR grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
                    license to download and use SEKTUR applications on Apple devices you own or control, solely for your
                    personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>
                <p>You may not:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Copy, modify, distribute, sell, or sublicense any part of any SEKTUR app</li>
                    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any SEKTUR app</li>
                    <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices or branding within any SEKTUR app</li>
                    <li>Use any SEKTUR app or the SEKTUR website for any unlawful purpose</li>
                    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any systems or networks associated with SEKTUR</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
                <p>Some SEKTUR apps offer in-app purchases, including one-time purchases and potentially
                    subscription-based options in future apps. The specific pricing, features, and purchase terms for
                    each app will be clearly presented within that app prior to purchase.</p>
                <p><strong>Restore Purchases:</strong> Where applicable, previously purchased features may be restored
                    at no charge using the "Restore Purchases" option within the app, provided you are using the same
                    Apple ID used for the original purchase.</p>
                <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> All purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. Refund requests
                    are subject to Apple's refund policies. We do not control or process refunds directly. To request a
                    refund, visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Abuse Prevention:</strong> Any attempt to fraudulently obtain paid features without payment —
                    including through unauthorized means, chargeback abuse, or exploitation of technical vulnerabilities
                    — is a violation of these Terms and may result in loss of access to the app.</p>
                <p><strong>Price Changes:</strong> SEKTUR reserves the right to change pricing for any app or feature at
                    any time. Price changes will not affect purchases already made.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>

                    trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>

                    branding without our prior written consent.</p>

                <h2>6. User Conduct</h2>

                    to use them in any way that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Violates any applicable local, state, national, or international law</li>
                    <li>Interferes with or disrupts the intended functionality of any SEKTUR app or the website</li>

                <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
                <p>SEKTUR apps and the website are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind,
                    either express or implied. SEKTUR does not warrant that any app or the website will be
                    uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</p>
                <p><strong>Not Professional Advice:</strong> SEKTUR apps are productivity and wellness tools. Nothing in
                    any SEKTUR app or on the SEKTUR website constitutes medical, psychological, financial, or legal
                    advice. Consult a qualified professional for advice specific to your situation.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Where SEKTUR apps store data locally on your device, SEKTUR is not
                    responsible for data loss resulting from device failure, app deletion, OS updates, or any other
                    cause.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, SEKTUR shall not be liable for any indirect,
                    incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of, or inability to
                    use, any SEKTUR app or the website — including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or
                    personal injury.</p>
                <p>In no event shall our total liability to you exceed the amount you paid for the relevant SEKTUR app
                    or feature, if anything.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
                    United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
                <p>Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms shall first be attempted to be resolved through
                    good-faith negotiation. If unresolved, disputes shall be submitted to binding arbitration in
                    California in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules, except that either party
                    may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p><strong>EU/UK Residents:</strong> If you are located in the European Union or United Kingdom, you may
                    also have the right to bring a claim before your local courts or applicable consumer protection
                    authority under local law.</p>

                    between you and SEKTUR only — Apple is not a party to these Terms and bears no responsibility for
                    SEKTUR apps or their content. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Apple's App Store
                    Terms, Apple's terms govern with respect to usage rules.</p>

                    responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of any third-party sites. Accessing

                    but not limited to Quota, Stasis, Entropy, Kinetic, Umbra, Trace, and Radiant. Individual apps may
                    supplement these Terms with additional terms specific to their features, functionality, or data
                    practices. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any app-specific terms, the
                    app-specific terms govern.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated"
                    date at the top of this page. Continued use of any SEKTUR app or the website after changes are

                    discretion, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other
                    users or to SEKTUR. Upon termination, your license to use the relevant app ceases immediately.</p>

                <h2>15. Severability</h2>

                    limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will continue in
                    full force and effect.</p>
