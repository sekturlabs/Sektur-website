      <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>

        <h3>The SEKTUR Website</h3>
        <p>The SEKTUR website (sektur.com) is a static site. We do not use cookies, analytics, pixels, or any tracking
          technology. The only personal data we collect via the website is what you voluntarily provide through our
          contact form: your name, email address, and message content.</p>

        <h3>SEKTUR Applications</h3>
        <p>Each SEKTUR app has its own data practices and its own app-specific privacy policy. Some apps store all data
          exclusively on your device and collect nothing. Other apps may use cloud services to provide features like
          syncing and account management.</p>
        <p>Please refer to the privacy policy for each specific app for details on what data it collects and how it is
          used. App-specific privacy policies are linked from within each app and from their respective pages on
          sektur.com.</p>
        <p>If there is a conflict between this policy and an app-specific policy, the app-specific policy governs for
          that app.</p>

        <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
        <p>Where SEKTUR apps offer in-app purchases, transactions are processed entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We
          do not receive, store, or process your payment card details. Apple's privacy policy governs these
          transactions:
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank"

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>We use personal data only for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Responding to inquiries:</strong> Replying to messages submitted through our contact form.</li>
          <li><strong>Providing and maintaining our apps:</strong> Delivering the features and functionality of each
            SEKTUR application.</li>
          <li><strong>Processing purchases:</strong> Facilitating in-app purchases handled by Apple via StoreKit.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> Meeting applicable legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing Your Data</h2>
        <p>We may share data with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service providers</strong> who help us deliver our services (e.g., Formspree for contact form
            processing, Apple for in-app purchases). These providers process data according to their own privacy
            policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Law enforcement</strong> when required by valid legal process, court order, or governmental
            regulation.</li>

      <!-- =============================== -->

      <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p><strong>Contact form submissions</strong> are retained in our email inbox only as long as needed to respond
          to
          your inquiry. We do not maintain formal databases of user contact information.</p>
        <p><strong>Device-only apps:</strong> For apps that store data exclusively on your device (e.g., Quota), we
          never
          receive or retain that data. Deleting the app deletes all data.</p>
        <p><strong>Cloud-connected apps:</strong> For apps that use cloud storage, your data is retained for as long as
          your account is active. Specific retention details are provided in each app's privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>In-app purchase records</strong> processed by Apple are subject to Apple's retention policies. We do
          not store payment card details.</p>

      <!-- =============================== -->

      <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>Security of Your Data</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us. For device-only apps, your data security is governed by your
          device's own protections (passcode, Face ID, device encryption). For cloud-connected apps and website
          submissions, we use industry-standard security measures including encryption in transit (TLS/HTTPS).</p>
        <p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive
          to use commercially reasonable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have the
          following rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or applicable local law:</p>
        <ul>

          <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>

        <p>The only personal data we currently process via the SEKTUR website is contact form submissions (name, email,
          message content). Our legal basis is legitimate interest — specifically, responding to your direct inquiry.
          Individual apps may process additional data under different legal bases, which will be disclosed in their
          app-specific privacy policies.</p>

        <h3>International Data Transfers</h3>
        <p>SEKTUR is based in the United States. Contact form submissions are processed by Formspree, also based in the
          United States. By submitting the contact form, you acknowledge that your data will be transferred to and
          processed in the United States. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international transfers
          where
          required by applicable law.</p>

        <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@sektur.com">hello@sektur.com</a>. We
