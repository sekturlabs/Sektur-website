            <p class="privacy-intro">Plain English summary: Use Quota honestly, don't abuse it, don't try to
                reverse-engineer it, and enjoy the app. These terms cover Quota and future SEKTUR apps.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-content">

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                <p>By downloading, installing, or using Quota ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of
                    Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App. These Terms apply to Quota and may apply
                    to future applications released under the SEKTUR brand, each of which will reference these Terms or
                    provide their own.</p>
                <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and SEKTUR, based in California,
                    United States.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use Quota. By using the App, you represent and warrant that
                    you meet this age requirement. If you are between 13 and 18 years old, you represent that your
                    parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>3. License to Use</h2>
                <p>Subject to these Terms, SEKTUR grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
                    license to download and use Quota on Apple devices you own or control, solely for your personal,
                    non-commercial purposes.</p>
                <p>You may not:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Copy, modify, distribute, sell, or sublicense any part of the App</li>
                    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
                    <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices or branding within the App</li>
                    <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose or in violation of these Terms</li>
                    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any systems or networks associated with SEKTUR</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
                <p>Quota Pro is available as a one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase at $4.99 USD (or local
                    equivalent). Upon purchase, Quota Pro features are permanently unlocked on your Apple ID account.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Restore Purchases:</strong> If you reinstall the App or use a new device with the same Apple
                    ID, you may restore your Quota Pro purchase at no charge using the "Restore Purchases" option in
                    Settings.</p>
                <p><strong>No Subscriptions:</strong> Quota Pro is a one-time purchase. We do not charge recurring fees
                    for any current Quota features.</p>
                <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> All purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. Refund requests
                    are subject to Apple's refund policies. We do not control or process refunds directly. To request a
                    refund, visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Abuse Prevention:</strong> Any attempt to fraudulently obtain Quota Pro without payment —
                    including through unauthorized means, chargeback abuse, or exploitation of technical vulnerabilities
                    — is a violation of these Terms and may result in loss of access to the App.</p>
                <p><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change the price of Quota Pro at any time.
                    Price changes will not affect purchases already made.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>Quota, its design, code, branding, name, and all associated content are the intellectual property of
                    SEKTUR and are protected by applicable copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.
                    The SEKTUR name and logo are proprietary to SEKTUR.</p>
                <p>Nothing in these Terms grants you any right to use the SEKTUR name, logo, or any other SEKTUR
                    branding without our prior written consent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>6. User Conduct</h2>
                <p>You agree to use the App only for its intended purpose — helping you manage your screen time and
                    build healthier digital habits. You agree not to use the App in any way that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Violates any applicable local, state, national, or international law</li>
                    <li>Interferes with or disrupts the App's intended functionality</li>
                    <li>Attempts to circumvent any features, including Pro feature gating</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
                <p>Quota is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or
                    implied. SEKTUR does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses
                    or other harmful components.</p>
                <p><strong>Not Medical Advice:</strong> Quota is a productivity and wellness tool. Nothing in the App
                    constitutes medical, psychological, or clinical advice. If you have concerns about screen time
                    addiction, mental health, or related issues, please consult a qualified healthcare professional.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Since all app data is stored locally on your device, SEKTUR is not
                    responsible for data loss resulting from device failure, App deletion, OS updates, or any other
                    cause. We recommend noting your progress if continuity is important to you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, SEKTUR shall not be liable for any indirect,
                    incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of, or inability to
                    use, the App — including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or personal injury.</p>
                <p>In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability,
                    our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. In no event shall our total
                    liability to you exceed the amount you paid for Quota Pro, if anything.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
                    United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
                <p>Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App shall first be attempted to be
                    resolved through good-faith negotiation. If unresolved, disputes shall be submitted to binding
                    arbitration in California in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules, except
                    that either party may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p><strong>EU/UK Residents:</strong> If you are located in the European Union or United Kingdom, you may
                    also have the right to bring a claim before your local courts or applicable consumer protection
                    authority under local law.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>10. Apple App Store Terms</h2>
                <p>Your use of Quota is also subject to Apple's App Store Terms of Service. These Terms are between you
                    and SEKTUR only — Apple is not a party to these Terms and is not responsible for the App or its
                    content. Apple has no obligation to provide support or maintenance for Quota. In the event of any
                    conflict between these Terms and Apple's App Store Terms, Apple's terms govern with respect to usage
                    rules.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated"
                    date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your
                    acceptance of the revised Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>12. Future SEKTUR Apps</h2>
                <p>SEKTUR plans to release additional apps under the SEKTUR brand. Future apps may reference these Terms
                    or provide their own terms specific to their features and functionality. These Terms apply to Quota
                    specifically and to any future SEKTUR app that expressly adopts them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>13. Termination</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App at our sole discretion, without
                    notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third
                    parties. Upon termination, your license to use the App ceases immediately.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>14. Severability</h2>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be
                    limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will continue in
                    full force and effect.</p>
