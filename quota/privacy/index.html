            <p class="privacy-intro">The short version: The Quota app collects no data from you. Everything stays on
                your device. The SEKTUR website collects only what you voluntarily submit via the contact form.</p>

                <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Quota is an app developed and published by SEKTUR, based in California, United States. References to
                    "we," "us," or "SEKTUR" in this policy refer to this entity.</p>

                <h2>2. The Quota App — No Data Collected</h2>
                <p>The Quota app does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data. All information you create
                    within the app — tasks, timers, streaks, history, settings — is stored exclusively on your device
                    using local storage. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.</p>
                <p>The app contains no analytics SDKs, advertising networks, crash reporting tools, or any third-party
                    code that transmits data off your device.</p>
                <p><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> If you purchase Quota Pro, the transaction is processed entirely
                    by Apple via StoreKit. We do not receive, store, or process your payment details. Apple's privacy
                    policy governs that transaction: <a href="https://apple.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">apple.com/legal/privacy</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> If you enable local reminders, these are scheduled entirely
                    on-device by iOS. No notification data is transmitted to our servers.</p>

                <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Quota is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
                    information from anyone under 13. Since the app collects no data at all, this is straightforwardly
                    satisfied. If you believe a child under 13 has submitted personal information to us via the website
                    contact form, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@sektur.com">hello@sektur.com</a> and we
                    will delete it promptly.</p>

                <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>Contact form submissions are retained in our email inbox only as long as reasonably necessary to

                <h2>8. Security</h2>
                <p>Since the Quota app stores all data locally on your device, the security of your app data is governed
                    by your device's own security (passcode, Face ID, etc.). For contact form submissions, Formspree
                    uses industry-standard security practices. No method of transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot
                    guarantee absolute security of information transmitted to us via email.</p>
